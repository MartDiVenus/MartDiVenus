- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @MartDiVenus
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in happiness.
- ğŸ“« My e-mail is marfant7@gmail.com
and my gpg public key is: \
https://github.com/MartDiVenus/MartDiVenus/blob/main/mario-fantini.public.asc

As soon as I'll straighten up my works, I'll move tar.xz packages, their integrities, their signatures on a different server;
and I'll extract their last versions in github branches: to respect github form/universe finally.
